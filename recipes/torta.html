    <h3>A Filipino ground beef omelette</h3>
    <p>A simple omelette filled with beef and vegetables. A simple dish perfect for eating any time of the day.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 Tbsp of Oil</li>
        <li>1 Onion, Diced</li>
        <li>3 Cloves of Garlic, Minced</li>
        <li>1 Tomato, Diced</li>
        <li>1 lb of Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of Salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp of Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 c of Peas</li>
        <li>5 Eggs, Lightly Beaten</li>
        <li>Vegetable or Canola Oil, for Frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until softened, 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the diced tomato to the skillet and continue cooking for 5 minutes, letting the tomatoes release their juices.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef to the vegetables and saute until browned, 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the salt and pepper, mix well. Taste the mixture and adjust the salt and pepper as needed.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a medium sized bowl. Add the peas and let the mixture cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Once the meat mixture had cooled, add the beaten eggs and mix well.</li>
        <li>Wipe out the skillet you used for the meat and heat a little oil in it, over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and spoon 1/4 c of the egg and beef mixture into the skillet, flatten the mixture and shape it roughly into a 3-4 inch patty. (Depending on the size of your skillet, you may be able to cook more than one omelette at a time. Just be careful not to overcrowd the pan, or flipping the omelettes will be difficult.)</li>
        <li>Cook the omelette for 2-3 minutes on the first side. (If your omelettes cook faster than this, your pan is too hot. Reduce the heat for the next batch.)</li>
        <li>Flip the omelette and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on the second side, until golden.</li>
        <li>Transfer the omelette to a paper towel-lined plate and continue with the remaining batter. (Keeping the plate with the cooked omelettes in a very low oven will keep them warm until all are made.)</li>
    </ol>
